# Cdda Content Expanded
My personal expansion to Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. The reason for this mod is being that some of what I want in the game doesn't align with that of the main development team for CDDA, instead I will maintain this mod with things I feel should be in the game. This is in now way meant to be any shade thrown at the devs, they are entitled to their creation just as I am with this mod.

As of now these are the features of CDDA:CE
- Low-Grade Methamphetamine is craftable albiet with the same locked requirement of finding the lab journal.
